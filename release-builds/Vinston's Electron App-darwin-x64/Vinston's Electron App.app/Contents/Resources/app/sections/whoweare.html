                   in the various engineering disciplines. Strive to increase the number of minority students studying engineering
                   at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Encourage members to seek advanced degrees in engineering
                   or related fields and to obtain professional engineering registrations. Promote public awareness of
                   engineering and the opportunities for Blacks and other minorities in that profession.
